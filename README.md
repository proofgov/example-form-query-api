## Example Form Query API

To start using the example application, follow the steps:

1. Set up environmental variables.
    ```bash
    export PROOF_URL=https://app.proofgov.com
    export PROOF_API_TOKEN=<some-token>
    ```

    If you were provided a Form ID, you can set it via:

    ```bash
    export PROOF_FORM_ID=1
    ```
2. Run `yarn install`.
3. Run `yarn setup-form` (this setups a new form, if needed, and updates the [schema](schema.yaml)).
4. If you want to generate sample submissioned; run `yarn generate-submission`.
5. Run `yarn server`.
6. Now you're ready to receive requests on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

### Sending Requests

Once you have the server runing, you can submit a request via cURL:
```bash
curl steve:password@localhost:4000/covid-cases
```

You can see and modify users/passwords in the `config.js` file.

### A few notes...
Both `yarn setup-form` and `yarn generate-submission` support a `--help` option for more details.

Running `yarn setup-form` may create a `provider_info.yaml` file that is used for subsequent requests.
 
In case you need to generate a lot of submissions, you can run `while true; do yarn generate-submission; done`. (`ctrl-c` to exit).
